# Moonlight Auto Installer Shell Script

This script will guide a user through the installation process of the Moonlight Embedded Streaming Service for the Raspberry Pi.
This will aid the user to run Steam In-Home Streaming straight from their Raspbian PIXEL Desktop.

To further simplify things, the script also creates Bash Aliases that will allow the user to seamlessly start the service in a variety of modes.
It also allows them to re-pair Moonlight with one command, should it be necessary.
